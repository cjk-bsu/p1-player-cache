In this project, we will design an implementation of a cache using a linked list data structure available in the Java LinkedList class.  The Cache class should allow for storing generic type objects. We will then use a specific instance of the Cache class to store Player objects (Player class is provided in the starter code).  In addition, we will write an accompanying test program to test our Cache<Player> implementation using serialized Player objects that will be read from a file on the disk.
